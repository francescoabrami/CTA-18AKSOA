# Controlli Automatici CTA-18AKSOA 🎛️

This repository is intended to contain all the files necessary for compiling a main.pdf document useful for studying and preparing for the subject Automatic Controls.

Knowing that not all students might be able to download and compile the file on their own the repository implements some automations to keep the latest version compiled and available to download. In this case the file is released in the repository with a version number that indicates the latest version available. For more information about the process check the sections below.
